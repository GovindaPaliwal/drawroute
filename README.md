===========

DrawRoute wraps Google Directions API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) using RxJava for Android so developers can download, parse and draw path on the map in very fast and flexible way (For now only JSON support).


The library contains two main parts.
 - **RouteAPI**
    is responsible for sending request to **Google's Direction API** and handling the response
 - **DrawerAPI**
    is responsible for drawing the path on the map


How to add (gradle)
===========
If you are using gradle:
Step1: Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories
```xml
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Step2: Add the dependency
```xml
dependencies {
      ...
	  implementation 'com.github.malikdawar:drawroute:1.0'
}
```
Otherwise you have to use library directly in your project.

USAGE
===========
First we have to download the path. For this we need to provide two points (start and end) and travel mode.


```Kotlin
interface RouteApi {
	fun getJsonDirections(
		start: LatLng,
		end: LatLng,
		mode: TravelMode,
		apiKey: String
	): Observable<String?>?
}

```

Where travel mode can be:

```Kotlin
enum class TravelMode {
	DRIVING, WALKING, BICYCLING, TRANSIT
}

```

As you can see the above method returns Observable and our response is a String.
So far so good, we downloaded the route but what the hell - response as String, I don't want to parse it on my own.

With RxJava and some transformations nothing more easily.

Have a look:

```Kotlin
val routeRest = RouteRest()
	routeRest.getJsonDirections(
		source, destination, //starting and ending point
		TravelMode.DRIVING, //Travel mode
		"Your api key" //google maps API from GCP, make sure google directions are enabled
	)
		?.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
		?.map { s -> RouteJsonParser<Routes>().parse(s, Routes::class.java) }
		?.subscribe { r -> routeDrawer.drawPath(r) }
		
```

The most important part here is

```Kotlin
 .map { 
	s -> RouteJsonParser<Routes>().parse(s, Routes::class.java) 
 }
 
```

For more details about 'map' operator can be find here - https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Transforming-Observables#map
In short, we parse our response to Routes object, so now we can go to draw the path on the map.


Here we have to use DrawerApi which for now provides one method:
```Kotlin
fun drawPath(Routes routes);
```
(for now it forces to use Routes object).

We are almost there but before we invoke draw method we have to build our drawer using RouteDrawerBuilder.
It allows us to customize a little bit the path and the markers. It requires to get GoogleMap(!) and if we want we can provide
```
- marker icon
- path width
- path color
- marker alpha
```

This can look as

```Kotlin
    val routeDrawer = RouteDrawer.RouteDrawerBuilder(googleMap)
            .withColor(context!!.getColorCompat(R.color.colorPrimary))
            .withWidth(13)
            .withAlpha(0.6f)
            .withMarkerIcon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(BitmapDescriptorFactory.HUE_ORANGE))
            .build()
```


And taking all together:

```Kotlin

class YourFragment : Fragment(), OnMapReadyCallback {

    private var googleMap: GoogleMap? = null

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_map_route, container, false)
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
        //initialized google maps
        val mapFragment =
            childFragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.mapView) as SupportMapFragment
        mapFragment.getMapAsync(this)
    }

    override fun onMapReady(p0: GoogleMap?) {
        this.googleMap = p0

        val source = LatLng(31.490127, 74.316971) //starting point (LatLng)
        val destination = LatLng(31.474316, 74.316112) // ending point (LatLng)
	
		//check if map has been initialized
        googleMap?.run {
            //Called the drawRouteOnMap method to draw the polyline/route on google maps
			
            //creation of polyline with attributes
        val routeDrawer = RouteDrawer.RouteDrawerBuilder(this)
            .withColor(context!!.getColorCompat(R.color.colorPrimary))
            .withWidth(13)
            .withAlpha(0.6f)
            .withMarkerIcon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(BitmapDescriptorFactory.HUE_ORANGE))
            .build()

        //API call to get the path points from google
        val routeRest = RouteRest()
        routeRest.getJsonDirections(
            source, destination, //starting and ending point
            TravelMode.DRIVING, //Travel mode
            getString(R.string.google_map_api_key) //google maps API from GCP, make sure google directions are enabled
        )
            ?.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            ?.map { s -> RouteJsonParser<Routes>().parse(s, Routes::class.java) }
            ?.subscribe { r -> routeDrawer.drawPath(r) }
        }
    }
}
```
